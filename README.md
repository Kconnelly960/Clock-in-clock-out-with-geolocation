Authors: Kevin Connelly, Julie Bowes, Racheal Dietz, Bwahana Garg, Chen Zayden, Bruce Reece

This website was created for the "Software Engineering" class. This was a group project consisting of six people. 
The goal of the project was to design a clock-in/clock-out system that tracks users clock-in/clock-out times,
the ability to clock-in/out is restricted based on the users location in respect to the business location.

See User_manual for in-depth instruction on how the site works.
